\begin{block}{The Question: How Large Is \textbf{the MPC} $(\equiv \MPC)$?}
If households receive a surprise extra 1 unit of income,\\ how much will be in aggregate spent over the next year?
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Elements that interact with each other to produce the result:}
\bi
\item Households are heterogeneous
\item Wealth is unevenly distributed
\item $\cFunc$ function is highly concave
\item $\Rightarrow$ Distributional issues matter for aggregate C\\
Giving 1 to the poor $\ne$ giving 1 to the rich
